I'm Arthur, a data enthousiast. I am the guy who likes to *[Get Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done)* quickly and efficiently. So, I guess that's enough for an introduction - let's get to work !

## What do I like to do ?

* Tackle challenging problems related to data analysis and data engineering.
* Build scallable applications.
* Learning new skills and gaining knowledge related to Machine Learning and Data Engineering.
* Studying data and finding the right model to fit the real world and predict future in the most accurate way

## What's my background ?

I studied Computer Science at the [University of Technology of Compi√®gne](https://www.utc.fr/), a French's Engineering school. I have always been mesmerized by the beauty of math and how one can 
formulate an entire theory from very simple axioms. During my last year of studies, I specialized in Data Science because I was really attracted with the new challenges offered by the Big Data.

## Open Source, Scientific computing and Data Science experiences.

I started contributing to Open Source and to [*SciPy*](https://www.scipy.org/) in particular 
in February of 2021. Originaly, it was a school's project meant to set foot to the contributing comunity. Since I enjoyed it very much, I continue to do so in my free time. I also contributed to [*ViteMaDose*](https://github.com/CovidTrackerFr/vitemadose) project, which helps people to schedule a vaccination date in France. You can find the website [here](https://vitemadose.covidtracker.fr/).
